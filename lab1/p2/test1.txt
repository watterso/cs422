Decimal System

Decimal number system is the most commonly used and the most familiar one to
the general public. It is also known as Base 10 numbering system since it is
based on 10 following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. In decimal
system, every digit has its own position as well as the decimal point. I.e.
the number 356.74 has 4 in the Hundredths position, 7 in the Tenths position,
6 in the Units position, 5 in the Tens position, and 3 in the Hundreds
position. Decimal number system is also one of the oldest known numeral
system, which is historically related to Hindu-Arabic numeral system.

Hex System

Hex, or hexadecimal, is a number system of base 16. This number system is
especially interesting because in our casually used decimal system we have
only 10 digits to represent numbers. As hex system has 16 digits, the extra
needed 6 digits are represented by the first 6 letters of English alphabet.
Hence, hex digits are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9 A, B, C, D, E, F. This number
system is the most commonly used in mathematics and information technologies.
I.e. in html programming colors can be represented by a 6-digit hexadecimal
number: FFFFFF represents white, 000000 represents black, and so on.
