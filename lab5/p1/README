NOTES:
1. I have prepended a size field 4bytes long to by Frames, not depicted in my writeup
2. There is a timeout alarm, defaulted to 2ms, sometimes strange network behavior causes even the initial request to timeout, giving times that are 2ms slower.
3. All values to be modified are in myroadrunner.h
