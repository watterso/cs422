Usage is as described in the lab specs.

the max number of reminders and the length of a reminder is controlled in reminder.h.
max number of reminders: MAX_REMINDERS (defaults to 100)
max length of a reminder (number+text): MAX_REMINDER_LEN (defaults to 140)

ACK_WAIT (also defined in reminder.h) controls the timeout for waiting for an ACK.

Secret size is limited by PAYLOAD_SIZE. In practice it should be no larger than PAYLOAD_SIZE - 1 because of ACK overhead.
